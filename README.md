## Running on local with config

  

It's easy to run the performance test on local with config.

Prepare your test case file under the ```tests``` folder, and modify the ```master.conf``` file to set the test case file name.

  

Steps:

  

1. setup the python environment

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

  

2. prepare the test case file under the ```tests``` folder

ex: ```tests/locust_testfile.py```

  

3. modify the

```master.conf```

```

locustfile = tests/{TEST_CASE_FILE_NAME}.py

host = ""

users = {MAX_NUM_OF_USERS}

spawn-rate = {SPAWN_RATE}

run-time = 10m # set the run time

headless = true # if you want to run it without UI

```

  

4. execute the command to run the performance test

```locust -f master.conf```

## Dsitributed Performance Test on Kubernetes

  

* We use [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) to do deployment, so please check you have it.

  

Pre-Actions:

  

1. Build the docker image and push to the GCR

  

For Grafana:
```
cd {REPO_ROOT}/build/grafana
docker build -t {PATH_OF_DOCKER_NAME}:{TAG} .
docker push {PATH_OF_DOCKER_NAME}:{TAG}
```
<br>
For TimescaleDB:

```
cd {REPO_ROOT}/build/timescaledb
docker build -t {PATH_OF_DOCKER_NAME}:{TAG} .
docker push {PATH_OF_DOCKER_NAME}:{TAG}
```
<br>

For Locust:

```
cd {REPO_ROOT}/
docker build -t {PATH_OF_DOCKER_NAME}:{TAG} .
docker push {PATH_OF_DOCKER_NAME}:{TAG}
```
<br>
  
2. Push the test file to Git Repo

3. Modify the ```helm/values.yml``` file to set the image path, test file, repo...etc


#### Steps:

1. Go to kubernetes cluster and assign the namespace
```kubectl config set-context --current --namespace={NAMESPACE}```

2. install the helm chart
```helm install {RELEASE_NAME} helm/```

3. Wait for the pods are ready, then forward the port to your local to access locust UI
```kubectl port-forward service/locust-service 8000:80```

```
if you want to establish a public link to access the locust UI, you can use the following command to get the public IP and setup ingress
```

4. open the ```http://localhost:8000/``` on your browser then you should see the locust page with workers

All set. Enjoy it!
